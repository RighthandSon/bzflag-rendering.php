A PHP 7.1+ package for drawing BZFlag related things such as map thumbnails; this is a sister project to [bzflag-networking.php](https://github.com/allejo/bzflag-networking.php).

## Why is this a separate package?

This package is dedicated to drawing and rendering BZFlag related images or files meaning this will have dependencies for drawing. In order to allow these dependencies to be "opt-in," it is a separate package. However, the namespace of this project is shared with its sister project.
